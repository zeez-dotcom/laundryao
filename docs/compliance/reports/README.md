# Compliance Reports

Quarterly compliance and recovery drill reports are generated automatically by the `ComplianceScheduler`. Each run creates or appends to a Markdown report named `compliance-report-<year>-q<quarter>.md`.

Manual updates (e.g., tabletop summaries) should be appended under a new `---` divider with the timestamp of the entry.
